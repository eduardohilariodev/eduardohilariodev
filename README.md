Hello there, my name is Eduardo Hilário
=======================================================================================================================================

I'm a software engineer and designer, from Brazil. I work on lots of stuff, on the client-side, on the server-side and on the human-side!  I love learning and broadening my knowledge, be it from courses, books, documentaries or college (already did a BA in Design, now I am going for a second run in Computer Science).

🌍  I'm based in Brazil (GMT -3).
